The average birth rate in South Korea dropped to a fresh low of 0.84 last year, the worldâ€™s lowest, which population experts said will unlikely bounce back without an increase in decent jobs and affordable housing for young adults.
The 2020 number compared with 0.92 recorded a year earlier, meaning since 2018 the average South Korean woman gives birth to fewer than one child during her lifetime, Statistics Korea said on Feb. 24. The tally marked the lowest since the country began compiling the data.
